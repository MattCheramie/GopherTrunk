# GopherTrunk 📻🐹

A headless, low-latency digital-trunking scanner engine in Go.

GopherTrunk manages a pool of RTL-SDR dongles, runs a custom Go DSP
pipeline, decodes the signalling layers of every major trunked-radio
family (P25 Phase 1 / Phase 2, DMR Tier II / III, NXDN, Motorola Type II /
SmartZone, EDACS / GE-Marc, LTR, MPT 1327, dPMR Mode 3, TETRA TMO)
plus the D-STAR + Yaesu System Fusion amateur modes, follows voice
grants by talkgroup priority, and streams metadata + audio to any
frontend over gRPC, HTTP/SSE, or WebSocket.

| Orchestration     | In-process pub/sub event bus with typed payloads (Grant / CallStart / CallEnd / DecodeError / ToneAlert / etc.) and a typed `events.Stage` enum so protocol packages can't accidentally publish a stage label that drifts from the Prometheus dashboards, `System` model, JSON-on-disk last-known-CC cache, control-channel `Hunter` that retunes the SDR and parks on the first responsive frequency |
| Trunking engine   | Cross-protocol `Grant` payload, Trunk-Recorder-format talkgroup DB (CSV + JSON), priority + preemption (emergency overrides, strict-higher), voice-device pool allocator, central state machine emitting `CallStart` / `CallEnd` events with a watchdog for silent calls |
| Demod pipeline    | `internal/voice/composer` subscribes to `CallStart` events, opens the bound Voice device's IQ stream, runs an LPF → decimate → optional CMA equalizer → FM demod → optional 75/50µs de-emphasis → optional Kaiser audio LPF → optional audio AGC → optional polyphase L/M resample (or naive decimate fallback) → int16 PCM chain into the recorder, and pings `Engine.Touch` every second so the silent-call watchdog leaves the call alone |
| Simulcast / "True I/Q" | `internal/dsp/equalizer` (LMS + CMA blind equalizers) for inter-symbol-interference / multipath mitigation, plus `internal/dsp/diversity` (Selection + maximal-ratio combiners over a shared `Combiner` interface) for multi-receiver IQ combining |
| Tone-out alerting | `internal/voice/toneout` runs Goertzel filters against each Voice device's PCM stream, matches QC-II two-tone-sequential sequences against operator-configured profiles with per-tone duration + cooldown, and publishes `tone.alert` events that fan out through SSE / WebSocket / gRPC |
| Voice recording   | `Vocoder` plugin interface + `NullVocoder` baseline, 16-bit PCM mono WAV writer with patched-length trailers, per-call recorder writing `<system>/<tg>/<UTC>_src<id>.wav` plus an optional raw-frame sidecar so users can BYO decoder; EDACS ProVoice grants always force a `.raw` sidecar (the vocoder is patent + trade-secret encumbered) so researchers can decode out-of-band |
| API               | `proto/*.proto` schemas under repo root; HTTP REST (`/api/v1/{health,version,systems,talkgroups,calls/active,calls/history}`); operator mutations gated behind `api.allow_mutations` (`GET /api/v1/mutations` capability probe; `POST /api/v1/calls/{serial}/end`; `PATCH /api/v1/talkgroups/{id}`; `POST /api/v1/retention/sweep`; `POST /api/v1/devices/{serial}/tone-reset`); Server-Sent Events stream (`/api/v1/events`); WebSocket bridge (`/api/v1/events/ws`); gRPC `SystemService` + `TalkgroupService` + `AudioService` over the same in-process state |
| Persistence       | Pure-Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`) call log subscribing to `CallStart` / `CallEnd` events; newest-first history queries with system / group / time filters; retention sweeper that ages out DB rows and recorded `.wav` / `.raw` files past configurable cutoffs |
| Observability     | Prometheus collector (events / calls / CC-locked / IQ-underrun / USB-reconnect / decode-error / SDR-attached / build-info series) exposed at `/metrics`; multi-stage `Dockerfile`; `docker-compose.yml` with RTL-SDR USB pass-through, healthcheck, and Prometheus scrape labels |
| Daemon            | `cmd/gophertrunk run` composes everything above into a single supervised process with signal-driven shutdown; every component is opt-in via `config.yaml` |
| Testing           | Per-package unit tests under `make test`; `make integration` boots the wired daemon end-to-end (no SDR), publishes a synthetic call on the bus, and asserts the engine + recorder + call log + metrics + API agree — runs on every CI build |

## Status & known gaps

End-to-end audio works today for **analog FM voice channels**: the
control channel locks, the engine allocates a Voice device on a
grant, the composer pulls IQ → PCM → WAV, and the call is logged to
SQLite. The honest gaps:

- **Digital voice** (P25 Phase 1 IMBE; AMBE+2 for P25 Phase 2 / DMR
  / NXDN) is gated on the vocoders. The `Vocoder` plugin interface
  + raw-frame sidecar are in place; pure-Go IMBE now produces
  intelligible audio end-to-end ([patents have expired](docs/vocoders.md)),
  with §6.4 overlap-add windowing + §6.2 spectral enhancement +
  spec-derived gain calibration as quality follow-ups. AMBE+2
  stays behind the `mbelib` build tag.
- **Higher-fidelity audio**: the FM chain now has opt-in 75/50µs
  de-emphasis, a Kaiser-windowed audio LPF, audio AGC, and a
  polyphase L/M audio resampler — the full polish stack ships.
  Defaults stay analog-FM-friendly so digital protocols and
  passthrough callers see no behavior change.

The Go interfaces and event payloads carry digital protocols already,
so the remaining paths light up once IMBE drops in.

## Roadmap

What's still on the table. Order isn't fixed; each item is contained
to its own package and lands independently.

- **Pure-Go IMBE vocoder.** A native-Go IMBE 4400 bps decoder for
  default builds without a CGO dependency. Core US patents are
  expired; the algorithm is implementable from TIA-102.BABA. The
  `mbelib` build-tagged path already covers IMBE for operators with
  libmbe installed. Status: skeleton + Vocoder interface registered
  as `imbe-go`; per-vector channel-coding FEC inverse
  (Golay(23,12) for u_0..u_3 + Hamming(15,11) for u_4..u_6 + no-FEC
  u_7 passthrough) is in (`internal/voice/imbe/channel.go`); the
  TIA-102.BABA §7.4 u_0-keyed LCG pseudo-random scrambler is in
  (`scrambler.go`); full §5.3 / §5.4 / Annex E parameter unpack
  (b_0 → ω₀ + L + K + Vl voicing + Gm PRBA gains + Cik spectral
  coefficients + Tl log-amplitude residuals via two inverse DCTs)
  is in (`params.go` / `tables.go`); §6.1 cross-frame log2(Ml)
  prediction (eqs. 75-77 — γ = 0.65 interpolation of prev-frame
  harmonics at l · ω₀_curr/ω₀_prev positions, DC-bias removal,
  Tl residual addition) is in on a `SynthState` that the
  excitation step extends (`synth.go`); §6.2 amplitude prep
  (log2(Ml) → linear Ml = 2^log2(Ml), the R_M0 = Σ Ml² and
  R_M1 = Σ Ml² · cos(ω₀·l) spectral moments, and a voicing-fraction
  summary that the synthesis combiner consumes) is in (`amps.go`);
  §6.3 voiced harmonic generator (per-harmonic sinusoid at l · ω₀
  with linear amp tilt M_prev → M_curr + quadratic phase
  integration of the ω₀ drift, dual-frame iteration so
  voiced↔unvoiced transitions fade in / out cleanly) is in
  (`synth_voiced.go`, `SynthState` extended with `PrevPhase` +
  `PrevMl`); §6.4 unvoiced excitation (256-point FFT spectrum
  shaping — bins under voiced harmonics zeroed, bins under
  unvoiced harmonics scaled by Ml[l], bins outside [1..L]
  zeroed, conjugate-mirror invariant preserved so the IFFT
  output stays real-valued) is in (`synth_unvoiced.go`);
  caller supplies the noise buffer so unit tests stay
  deterministic; the §6.4 overlap-add synthesis window
  (256-sample periodic Hann × IFFT, 96-sample tail threaded
  through `SynthState.PrevUnvoicedTail` so frame boundaries are
  click-free) is in via `SynthUnvoicedOverlapAdd`; the §6.2
  spectral-amplitude enhancement (per-harmonic W_l =
  (0.96 · num/den)^0.25 clamped to [0.5, 1.2] for mid/high-band
  harmonics + low-band W = 1, followed by an energy-preserving
  rescale that holds R_M0 stable) is in (`enhance.go`); the
  output gain calibration is now a per-frame fast-attack /
  slow-release peak-envelope tracker on the Decoder (target peak
  24000, attack 0.4, release 0.02, gain clamped to [10, 1e5])
  with first-frame seeding, freeze-on-silence, and Reset clearing
  — replaces the prior `pcmGain = 4096` magic constant with
  consistent loudness across speech-pause-speech transitions.
  **`Decode()` emits real audio**: 88 info bits → params →
  §6.1 prediction → linear Ml → §6.2 enhancement → §6.3 voiced
  harmonic sum + §6.4 unvoiced excitation with overlap-add
  additive into one buffer → state roll-forward → per-frame AGC
  → int16 PCM at 8 kHz. Silence-window frames (b_0 ∈ [216, 219])
  still fade the prev unvoiced tail through the overlap region
  before resetting SynthState — no click on the silence
  boundary, and the AGC envelope is preserved across the
  silence so the next non-silent frame applies the same gain.
  Three decoder constructors are exposed: `New()` seeds the
  unvoiced noise source from a fixed default for reproducibility;
  `NewWithSeed(seed)` lets parallel calls + production callers
  spread noise across decoders; `NewWithConfig(seed, AGCConfig{...})`
  takes a public `AGCConfig` (TargetPeak / Attack / Release /
  MinGain / MaxGain / NoiseFloor) so operators can dial level +
  responsiveness for their downstream chain — zero-value fields
  backfill from `DefaultAGCConfig()` so partial overrides like
  `AGCConfig{TargetPeak: 16000}` (drop level by ~3 dB) keep the
  rest of the defaults. **Frame-repeat on bad-frame indicator**:
  a bad frame (UnpackParams error from upstream FEC slip)
  following a good frame replays the cached params with M scaled
  by 0.7 per consecutive bad frame; up to 6 consecutive bad
  frames bridge ~120 ms of weak signal before Decode emits silence
  + clears the cache. The repeat path freezes the AGC envelope
  so the attenuation is audible (signals signal degradation).
  **Remaining audio polish**: comparison-tuning the absolute
  output level against an mbelib reference (the AGC keeps
  intra-stream levels consistent but mbelib-bit-equivalent
  calibration is still a future follow-up); enhancement filter
  tuning if real-world frames show mid-band envelope drift.
- **DVSI USB-3000 / AMBE-3003 hardware backend.** A `Vocoder`
  factory that opens a connected DVSI USB chip. Same plug-in shape
  as `internal/voice/mbelib`; the daemon picks the factory by name
  from `voice.DefaultRegistry`.
- **YSF Trellis decode + grant emission.** Sync, frame layout, and
  the post-FEC FICH bit-level parser are in; what's left is the
  K=5 ½-rate Viterbi Trellis decoder over the on-air 100-bit FICH
  region and the control-channel wiring that publishes
  `protocol = "ysf"` grants on the bus when a Header FICH lands.
- **Higher-fidelity FM voice chain.** ✅ Shipped: opt-in 75/50µs
  de-emphasis (`composer.DeEmphasisConfig`), Kaiser-windowed audio
  LPF (`composer.AudioLPFConfig`), audio AGC
  (`composer.AudioAGCConfig`), and polyphase L/M audio resampler
  (`composer.AudioResamplerConfig`).

## Quick start

### Download a prebuilt release

Each tagged release publishes installers / archives on the
[**Releases page**][releases]:

| Platform   | File                                                   | What it is                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows 11 | `gophertrunk-<ver>-windows-amd64-setup.exe`            | One-click installer (Inno Setup, bundles librtlsdr DLLs) |
| Windows 11 | `gophertrunk-<ver>-windows-amd64.zip`                  | Portable ZIP — same files, no installer                  |
| Linux      | `gophertrunk-<ver>-linux-amd64.tar.gz`                 | Tarballed binary + sample config                         |

Windows users: after running the installer, follow
[`docs/install-windows.md`](docs/install-windows.md) to swap the
RTL-SDR driver to WinUSB via Zadig — the OS won't see your dongle
until that's done. The installer's last page links there too.

[releases]: https://github.com/MattCheramie/GopherTrunk/releases

### Build from source

### Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

See [`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md) for `udev` rules and DVB
blacklisting on Linux.

### Build, test, run

```sh
make build         # produces ./bin/gophertrunk
make test          # go test -race ./...
make integration   # boots the wired daemon end-to-end (no SDR needed)

./bin/gophertrunk version
./bin/gophertrunk sdr list                # enumerates attached dongles
./bin/gophertrunk run -config config.yaml
```

A starter [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) is in the
repo root — copy it, set the `serial` of your dongle from
`gophertrunk sdr list`, point `talkgroup_file` at a
Trunk-Recorder-format CSV, and you're going.

### Docker

```sh
docker compose up -d
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/metrics | grep gophertrunk_build_info
```

[`docs/hardening.md`](docs/hardening.md) has the full operator
playbook — Prometheus catalogue, USB pass-through recipe, smoke
tests.

## TUI

GopherTrunk ships a read-only operator TUI that points at a running
daemon. From a second terminal:

```bash
gophertrunk tui                    # default: http://127.0.0.1:8080
gophertrunk tui -server http://10.0.0.5:8080
gophertrunk tui -no-color          # disable ANSI colour
gophertrunk tui -insecure          # skip TLS verification
```

Eight panels covering every read surface, vim-style navigation, live
SSE event stream, periodic REST refresh, automatic reconnect on
disconnect:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | next / previous panel |
| `1`–`8` | jump to Dashboard / Systems / Talkgroups / Active / History / Events / Tones / Metrics |
| `j` / `k` | move row up / down inside a table |
| `/` | filter (Talkgroups, Events) |
| `s` | cycle sort (Talkgroups) |
| `p` | pause auto-scroll (Events) |
| `r` | reload (History) |
| `?` | toggle help |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | quit |

For mutation actions (end-call, set-priority, lockout,
retention-sweep, tone-detector reset) start the daemon with
`api.allow_mutations: true` and the TUI with `--write`. Both ends
gate independently because the HTTP API has no authentication.
